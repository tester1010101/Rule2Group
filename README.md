# Rule2Group :tada: :confetti_ball:
* :christmas_tree: Simple script to add any firewall rule (by "Name"), to any "Group", just type it.
* :sparkles: Script must be run through an Administrator PowerShell Terminal (see picture #1 / to apply into a group)
* :no_entry_sign: Note: The rules cannot be edited when they are added to a group, just make sure to do any required modifications before.
* :school_satchel: If you're wise enough you can script the whole thing to add/remove modifications to rules when needed, automatically.
